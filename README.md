# Objective
We have never created an ios app or worked with any tools in the ecosystem. The objective of this project was to 1. setup all the tools and 2. get comfortable with the swift language and the development/debugging workflow.

## Setup
The first step of our setup was creating an establishing our git repository and ensuring our git accounts were set up properly. This took some time to configure properly and remember how to set up proper branch protection.

Next we installed and set up swift and xcode. This took longer than expected due to one of us working on linux which is not natively supported by Apple's Xcode and is necessary to compile iOS apps. To get around this, we installed [xtool](https://github.com/xtool-org/xtool), a cross-platform Xcode replacement, on the Linux machine.

## Basic App
In order to get started with creating apps, we decided to create a simple demo app used to make swim workouts. The focus was on putting together a front end and understanding what the next steps would be to create a real, useable application.

# Installation Instructions
Open project in Xcode. Connect iOS device and flash.
